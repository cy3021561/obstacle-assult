## Overview

Obstacle Assault is an exciting course project developed for the Udemy course "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games." The project focuses on implementing various gameplay mechanics and features using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and C++ programming. By building upon existing assets and learning how to create custom functionalities in C++, Obstacle Assault provides an interactive and educational experience for aspiring game developers.

## Project Plan

1. **Create a Project with Existing Assets:** Obstacle Assault begins by setting up the project environment using pre-existing assets, allowing students to focus on learning C++ implementation without worrying about asset creation.

2. **Install the Tools for C++:** Students will be guided through the process of installing the necessary tools and plugins required for C++ development within Unreal Engine 5.

3. **Make a Moving Platform:** Students will learn to create a dynamic moving platform within the game using C++ scripting. This feature introduces the concept of interactive elements in the game world.

4. **Configure the Moving Platform:** The course will cover how to configure the behavior and movement of the platform, allowing students to customize the platform's characteristics based on their creative vision.

5. **Send the Platform Back:** Students will learn how to manage platform movement in both forward and backward directions, adding complexity to the gameplay.

6. **Rotating Platforms:** The project expands by introducing rotating platforms, providing a deeper understanding of C++ implementation for interactive game elements.

## What I Learned

1. **Linking UE5 Blueprint to C++:** Students will gain hands-on experience in linking Unreal Engine 5's Blueprint system with C++ code, enabling them to leverage the strengths of both visual scripting and programming.

2. **C++ Custom Character Class:** The course will cover the creation of a custom character class using C++. Students will learn how to add unique functionalities and behaviors to the character.

3. **C++ Compilation and Live Coding:** Through practical examples and live coding sessions, students will learn the process of compiling C++ code in Unreal Engine 5 and see how changes in code instantly affect the game.
